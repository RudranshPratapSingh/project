                As a Briton born to two wonderful parents of diametrically opposite culture 
                and religions, I’m a ‘third culture’ child.  Having spent my formative years
                in Dubai, a melting pot of over 120 nationalities, I see myself as a world 
                citizen. I’m a smorgasbord of different cultures that I have had imprinted 
                on my being by interacting by my social circle which is a United Nations 
                 of sorts.

                I love music and I love the way it influences people’s moods, beliefs, 
                opinions and actions. Music knows no race, creed, religion, gender or skin 
                colour. Music is for everyone and if music was a language it would be a 
                universal language of peace.

                My songs tell stories. Stories either derived from my own personal experiences,
                 or the experiences of people close to me whom I love. Or even world events that
                  I feel strong about.

                I believe artists have a role to play in making life better for as many people as they
                 can, through their music and the messages that their music carries. Life is always more 
                 beautiful with music in it.
